A calculator that will give you the best optimal intercept course to the target. 

Plug in your max speed, target speed, target direction, target heading, and target distance and get a calculated intercept point. 
You can also input a Desired Time to Intercept which will allow you to slow your ship down and take a new course (if for some reason you need to do that).

Instructions and the math are at the bottom of the page.
